## Testing

To test the functionality of our app, two approaches of testing are implementated:
First, we used intrumentation test (`/src/AndroidTest`) to verify the UI functionality of our application. This is realized with [`Espresso`](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-testing/espresso-testing.html) framework by Google.
Secondly, we implemented Junit test ( (`/src/test`)) to make sure our User model functions correctly.

To run the instrumentation test:
* Using the left pane, change the Project view to __Project__ (default)
* Open `app/src/androidTest/`
* Right-click on `androidTest/java/` and click __Run 'All Tests'__
* Select your preferred device to run UI tests on
